Demo of changing the OpenGraph tags read by Facebook based on query parameters
==============================================================================

* Read a query parameter
* Set OpenGraph tags based on that parameter
* Also set the canonical URL so Facebook treats the URLs differently
* Lint the URLs using the Facebook Debugger to ensure FB is reading correctly.
